# Tic-Tac-Toc

Basic Tic-Tac-Toe web game developed for the Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project also uses
Bootstrap framework and jQuery library.

## Development process

I invested around 40 hours in this project. The most important thing I did was to
whiteboard my problems before trying to code a solution. That gave me a clear sight
of what I wanted and what I needed before trying to solve the problem without any
path to follow.

## User-Stories

1. As a player, I want to see my life-time score so I can compare myself with my friends.
2. As a player, I want to be able to change between 'X' or 'O'.
3. As a player, I want to play against other people so the game becomes more interesting.
4. As a mobile user, I want to be able to play the game from my mobile device.
